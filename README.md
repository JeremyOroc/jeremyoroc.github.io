# Welcome to Jeremy's Portfolio!

This is my personal portfolio originally created for my Fall 2022 - Job Preparation course. It is a GitHub Pages link that includes a small introduction to myself, a list of my skills and experiences as well as some of my best projects on GitHub. The page was created using a MTL5 + CSS3 template called *Massively*.
